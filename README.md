# üê± meow

A powerful, modular dotfiles management system that helps developers quickly set up and maintain their development environment across different machines.

## üöÄ What is meow?

meow is a Shell-based dotfiles management system that automates the setup of your development environment using predefined configurations called "presets." Whether you're setting up a new machine, switching between work and personal configurations, or maintaining consistency across multiple devices, meow simplifies the process with just a single command.
